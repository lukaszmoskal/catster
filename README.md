# Catster

> Front-end app for [TheCatAPI](https://thecatapi.com/)

## General info

I've created this little app in a process of learning ReactJS. It was fun.

## Features

- Browse random pictures of cats from [TheCatAPI](https://thecatapi.com/)
- Read interesting facts about cats (if available in the API)
- Save favourite pictures in the local database of your browser

## Demo

You can try Catster here: [catster.netlify.app](https://catster.netlify.app)

## Technologies

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - v16.13.1
- [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/) - v4.11.0 Probably an overkill for such a simple app but I was curious and wanted to try how it works
- [PouchDB](https://pouchdb.com/) - v7.2.2

## Setup

To run Catster locally on your machine you need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed.

- clone this repo and install dependencies `$ npm install`
- `$ npm start` to run Catster at localhost:3000
- enjoy!
